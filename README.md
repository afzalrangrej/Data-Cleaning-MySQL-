SQL Data Cleaning Project — Layoffs Dataset <br><br>
A practical SQL project that demonstrates how to transform messy, real-world data into clean, analysis-ready tables using MySQL. This repository focuses on reproducible data cleaning patterns you can reuse in analytics, reporting, and application backends. <br><br>
<b>Project Overview</b>: <br><br>
Purpose: <br>
To showcase end-to-end data cleaning using pure SQL on a real layoffs dataset. <br>

Problems Solved: <br>
Inconsistent text values (e.g., company names, industries) <br>
Duplicate records <br>
Missing or NULL values <br>
Incorrect data types (dates stored as text) <br>
Non-standardized categorical fields <br>
Dirty data that blocks accurate analysis <br>

Core Idea: <br>
Use SQL as a full data preparation tool, not just for querying. The project demonstrates how to: <br>

Audit raw data quality <br>
Clean and standardize records <br>
Preserve original data <br>
Produce a trusted “final” table ready for analytics <br>
